# Twitterelection_dataanalysis

The objective of this project is to analyze Twitter data related to the 2020 U.S. election using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and time series analysis 
to uncover patterns in public sentiment, trending topics, and engagement over time and across regions.

The project will involve sentiment analysis, trend detection, and predictive modeling to understand how discussions evolved during the election period. 

The final deliverable will be an interactive dashboard that visualizes these insights, allowing users to explore the data and gain actionable information
about public opinion and the impact of key events. 

Objectives:

Sentiment Analysis: 
Identify shifts in public opinion during the election.

Trend Detection: 
Highlight key topics and hashtags that trended throughout the election period.

Predictive Modeling: 
Forecast future trends or sentiments based on the data collected during the election.


Time Series Analysis Tasks

Level 1:
Geospatial Time Series Analysis

Objective: Analyze tweet activity, sentiment, and engagement (likes, retweets) over time and across regions.
Approach: Apply techniques such as moving averages, seasonal decomposition, and trend detection (e.g., Prophet).
Outcome: Visualizations showing trends and identification of peak periods in engagement and activity.
Engagement Prediction

Objective: Predict future engagement metrics (likes, retweets) using historical data.
Approach: Use time series forecasting models such as ARIMA or exponential smoothing.
Outcome: Predictive models that estimate future engagement levels.

Level 2:
Anomaly Detection

Objective: Detect unusual spikes or drops in tweet activity, sentiment, or engagement.
Approach: Implement advanced techniques like Seasonal Hybrid Extreme Studentized Deviate (S-H-ESD) or deep learning models for anomaly detection.
Outcome: Identification of events or actions that cause anomalies in the data.
Causal Impact Analysis

Objective: Assess the impact of specific events (e.g., debates, policy announcements) on tweet activity and sentiment.
Approach: Use Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) to quantify the effect of events.
Outcome: Quantifiable impact analysis correlated with key election events.


Natural Language Processing Tasks

Level 1:
Sentiment Analysis

Objective: Classify the sentiment of tweets (positive, negative, neutral) to understand public opinion on various topics like the 2020 U.S. election or candidates.
Approach: Use pre-trained models such as VADER or Pysentimiento for sentiment analysis.
Outcome: Sentiment scores aggregated over time or by location.
Hashtag Analysis

Objective: Identify and analyze the most frequently used hashtags.
Approach: Use frequency analysis and clustering to group related hashtags.
Outcome: Insights into trending topics and their geographical distribution.

Level 2:
Stance Detection

Objective: Determine the stance (supportive, opposing, neutral) of tweets towards specific entities (e.g., political candidates).
Approach: Use models like SpaCy or fine-tuned transformers.
Outcome: Insights into public opinion and polarization.
Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Objective: Identify and categorize entities (people, organizations, locations) mentioned in tweets.
Approach: Use advanced NLP models like SpaCy for named entity recognition.
Outcome: Detailed analysis of which entities are being discussed and how they are connected.

Deliverables

Interactive Dashboard: 

A user-friendly dashboard visualizing insights from the analysis. Users can explore trends, public sentiment, and the impact of key election events.
We will use a Data Science Visualization tool such as Streamlit or Taipy.

Data Visualization

Create interactive visualizations using libraries such as Bokeh, Seaborn 
User Interface Design
Develop a user friendly UI dashboard that allows users of the tool to manipulate variables such as time or categories such as location, candidateâ€¦
